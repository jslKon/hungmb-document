* Java Core Interview Questions
** Basics
*** What is Java?
**** Object-oriented, platform-independent programming language
*** Features of Java
**** OOP, Platform independence, Robustness, Security, etc.
*** JDK, JRE, JVM
**** Development Kit, Runtime Environment, Virtual Machine
*** Java Memory Management

**** Stack
***** Store local primitive variables and references to object
***** Data is only available while the method or block that created it is executing

**** Heap
***** Class instances

**** GC

** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*** Principles of OOP

**** Encapsulation
***** Bundling data with methods
***** Access control (private, protected, public)
**** Inheritance
***** Reusing code from parent class
***** Extending functionality
**** Polymorphism
***** Overloading (same method, different parameters)
***** Overriding (subclass method replacing parent method)
**** Abstraction
***** Hiding implementation details
***** Providing a simple interface

*** Classes and Objects
**** Blueprints and instances
*** Constructors
**** Special methods to initialize objects
*** Method Overloading vs Overriding
**** Compile-time vs Runtime polymorphism
*** Inheritance
**** Reusability of code
*** Interfaces and Abstract Classes
**** Contracts and partial implementation
*** Access Modifiers
**** Private, Default, Protected, Public
** Exception Handling
*** What is an Exception?
**** Runtime errors causing abnormal termination
*** Types of Exceptions
**** Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
*** Try-Catch-Finally
**** Handling exceptions gracefully
*** Throw vs Throws
**** Raising and declaring exceptions
*** Custom Exceptions
**** User-defined exception classes
** Collections Framework
*** What is Collections Framework?
**** Unified architecture for data manipulation
*** List, Set, Map
**** Key interfaces in Collections
*** ArrayList vs LinkedList
**** Differences in implementation and usage
*** HashSet vs TreeSet
**** Differences in performance and sorting
*** HashMap vs TreeMap
**** Key-value pairs with different ordering
*** Iterator vs ListIterator
**** Traversal of collections
** Multithreading and Concurrency
*** What is Multithreading?
**** Simultaneous execution of threads
*** Thread Lifecycle
**** New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Terminated
*** Creating Threads
**** Extending Thread class, Implementing Runnable
*** Synchronization
**** Controlling access to shared resources
*** Deadlock
**** Situation where threads are waiting forever
*** Executor Framework
**** Managing threads efficiently
** Java Input/Output (I/O)
*** What is Java I/O?
**** Reading and writing data streams
*** Byte Streams vs Character Streams
**** Handling raw vs character data
*** Serialization
**** Converting objects to byte streams
*** File Handling
**** Reading, writing, and manipulating files
** Java 8 Features (if relevant)
*** Lambda Expressions
**** Simplified syntax for anonymous classes
*** Stream API
**** Processing sequences of data
*** Functional Interfaces
**** Interfaces with a single abstract method
*** Optional Class
**** Handling null values more gracefully
*** Default Methods
**** Methods with implementation in interfaces
** Memory Management
*** Stack vs Heap
**** Memory allocation differences
*** Garbage Collection
**** Automatic memory management
*** Finalize Method
**** Cleanup before garbage collection
