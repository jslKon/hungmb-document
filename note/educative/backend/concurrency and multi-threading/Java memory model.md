# Java memory model

Formally, a memory model describes, given a program and an execution trace of that program, whether the execution trace
is a legal execution of the program.

The processor or the runtime to reorder memory operations or program statements for optimization and performance
reasons, as long as, write visibilities guaranteed by the model arenâ€™t violated
