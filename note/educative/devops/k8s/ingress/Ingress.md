# Ingress

Applications that are not accessible to users are useless. Kubernetes Services provide accessibility with a usability
cost. Each application can be reached through a different port. We cannot expect users to know the port of each service
in our cluster

Ingress objects manage external access to the applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster
